    <h4>An Intro to Jordan</h4>

    <p> Enter Jordan Nixon, a self-proclaimed nomad of sorts, having been born in Arizona, 
        spent a sunny seven years soaking in the Floridian sun, and settling in the mountains of Utah for 
        the past thirteen. Though he usually claims Utah as home, Jordan's introduction can be as diverse as 
        his journey, adapting to his audience's curiosity. A born storyteller, he's at his happiest weaving tales that 
        captivate anyone willing to lend an ear. When he's not spinning yarns, you'll find Jordan basking in the great outdoors, 
        whether it's the thrill of skiing, the finesse of soccer, the tranquility of a hike, or the competitive camaraderie of 
        pickleball and spikeball. If there's a river nearby, count him in for a kayaking adventure. Jordan's claim to fame? 
        A solid four years as a member of the One Voice Children's Choir, where his audience ranged from thousands in a 
        grand theater to millions on YouTube. 
        Currently navigating the sophomore scene at BYU, Jordan pursues everything with an infectious passion. 
        And if you ever need a fun fact on the spot, he'll proudly declare his lifetime allegiance to a soda-free existence. 
        Cheers to the soda-free maverick and his myriad of adventures! </p>
